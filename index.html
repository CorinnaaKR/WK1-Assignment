      <ul>
    <li>Giant Pandas are primarily herbivores, with bamboo making up about 99% of their diet. They consume large quantities of bamboo daily, which is low in nutrients, so they need to eat a lot to meet their energy needs.</li>
    <li> Giant Pandas also eat other plants, fruits, and on rare occasions, small animals. However, bamboo is their main, and favourite, food source.</li>
    <li>Due to their specialized diet, Giant Pandas evolved unique adaptations, such as strong jaws and teeth to help them chew through tough bamboo stalks. They also have a special digestive system that allows them to extract the maximum nutrients from bamboo.</li>
