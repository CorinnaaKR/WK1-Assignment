        <h3>The Panda Diet</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Giant Pandas are primarily herbivores, with bamboo making up about
            99% of their diet. They consume large quantities of bamboo daily,
            which is low in nutrients, so they need to eat a lot to meet their
            energy needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Giant Pandas also eat other plants, fruits, and on rare occasions,
            small animals. However, bamboo is their main, and favourite, food
            source.
          </li>
          <li>
            Due to their specialized diet, Giant Pandas evolved unique
            adaptations, such as strong jaws and teeth to help them chew through
            tough bamboo stalks. They also have a special digestive system that
            allows them to extract the maximum nutrients from bamboo.

          Information about the Panda habitat and the neccessity of captivity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Giant Pandas are native to the mountainous regions of central China,
          where they inhabit dense bamboo forests. These forests provide the
          necessary food and shelter for their survival.
        </li>
        <li>
          Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Giant Pandas are classified as
          vulnerable
        </li>
        <li>
          Conservation efforts include creating reserves and breeding programs.
          These programs aim to increase the population of Giant Pandas in
          captivity and eventually reintroduce them into the wild.
