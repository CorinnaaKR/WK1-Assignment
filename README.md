# WK1-Assignment

WK1 Project
I initially made a skeleton structure for my website with the idea of centering it around the books i like to read and creating my own virtual library. However, after further consideration of the webvsite intending to be deployed and viewable to the puiblic, as well as being used as a an example of my skills to future employment, i reconsidered the subject of my website.
I eventually settled on Giant Pandas as they are my favourite animal, and immediately I had a clear visual idea of how i wanted the website to look, which i had been struggling to visualise with my previous idea. I then did some reasearch for website about Giant Pandas, such as the World Wildlife Fund and Wikipeadia. This was both to look at how the webistes were laid out and styled, as well as what information they included. From there i started changing the sections names to reflect what i wants to include.
