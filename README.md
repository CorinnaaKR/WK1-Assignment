# WK1-Assignment

WK1 Project
I initially made a skeleton structure for my website with the idea of centering it around the books i like to read and creating my own virtual library. However, after further consideration of the webvsite intending to be deployed and viewable to the puiblic, as well as being used as a an example of my skills to future employment, i reconsidered the subject of my website.
I eventually settled on Giant Pandas as they are my favourite animal, and immediately I had a clear visual idea of how i wanted the website to look, which i had been struggling to visualise with my previous idea. I then did some reasearch for website about Giant Pandas, such as the World Wildlife Fund and Wikipeadia. This was both to look at how the webistes were laid out and styled, as well as what information they included. From there i started changing the sections names to reflect what i wants to include.
i inspected the WWF website to see how they laid out the html code, then did the same for the tomatoe time website when I couldn't figure out how to get my ul elements to sit in a row at the top of the page. I also checked out the flexbox section of the MND website.
I struggled to work out why i couldnt align the nav section of my code without effecting everything else so I went back through the code we had done in class, and adjusted my code structure to look more like that, i.e changing the ids into classes instead.
Kept getting errors messages in vs.code and wasn't able to see the website changes in the go live. Messaged in discord, uninstalled and reinstalled the extensions and tried changing my default web browser. Also had a research around about how to make an image my website background and then how to stop it repeating.
Gave up with the photo background and came to the conclusion it would be too distracting. Researched through CSS and I'm now trying to make an ombre background but it isnt showing so instead i'm filling out the information i want in the sections on my website and will come back to it.
Started looking for images to add in and continued editing the text, making them into lists instead of p elements as i thought it looked neater and easier to read.
